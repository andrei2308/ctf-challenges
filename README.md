# CTF Challenges Writeups

This repository is dedicated to documenting the CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges I’ve completed. The goal of this repository is not just to archive my own progress, but also to **teach others**, **share ideas**, and **explore new approaches** to solving security problems.

## **Scope of the Repository**
1. **Educational Focus**:
   - Provide clear and detailed explanations for every challenge.
   - Break down problems into manageable parts to help others understand and learn.
   - Share insights into techniques, tools, and thought processes used in solving challenges.

2. **Knowledge Sharing**:
   - Highlight common pitfalls and effective strategies.
   - Showcase creative ways to approach CTF problems, from binary exploitation to reverse engineering.

3. **Encouraging Collaboration**:
   - Serve as a platform for others to contribute their ideas or solutions.
   - Exchange knowledge and learn from others’ experiences.
